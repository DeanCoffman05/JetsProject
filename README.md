# Lessons Learned 
Never give up! I also learned and have a better grasp on access modifiers in 
relation to classes, methods, and other encapsulated objects in Java. It was 
a challenge to work with the text file, but I certainly see the value of it. 
The Array Lists were difficult at times but started to become a lot easier to work 
with their integrated methods for manipulating my data.
